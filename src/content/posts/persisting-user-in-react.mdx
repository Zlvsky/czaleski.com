Doing a quick research on the question "How to persist User in React" we will find many solutions. The most popular methods we can find are solutions using **localstorage**, **Cookies**, **sessionstorage** or external libraries.

Which method will be the best? Well, it depends:) I personally liked the method best, which I will describe to you in more detail shortly and demonstrate how to implement it.

## What do we want to achieve?

Let's start by writing out for ourselves what specifically we want to achieve - this will make it easier to visualize the implementation itself.

 1. After logging in, we need to store the token somewhere - in our case JWT.
 2. We also need to check if our token has expired.
 3. After re-entering the site, if the token is still valid, we should continue to be logged in.

Now let's get down to work ðŸ‘‡ 

## 1. Storing the token

The place where we will store our JWT token will be **Cookies**. For this I recommend the library [js-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-cookie), thanks to which we can easily save, delete and receive values from cookies, in addition, we can set for how long they should be valid.

So let's assume that we make a request to log in, if it succeeds we can save our token.

```ts
import Cookies from "js-cookie";

const handleLoginRequest = async () => {
  const dataToSend = {
    email,
    password
  };
  const response = await loginService(dataToSend);
  if (response.status !== 200) return console.log("LOGIN FAILED");
  // ON LOGIN SUCCESS  
  Cookies.set("jwt", response.data.token);
};
```

If we want to set, a specific validity of days of **cookies**, we can do it like this:

```ts
// TOKEN EXPIRES 7 DAYS FROM NOW
Cookies.set("jwt", response.data.token, { expires: 7 })
```

## 2. Controlling the validity of the token.

We already have a stored token with which we can make requests. Let's now get down to controlling its validity.

The key to this will be **request**, which will return to us, for example, the data of the logged-in user.

The place to store this data will be **store** in [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

So let's create a ```store.ts``` file in the ```/src/redux``` folder.

```ts
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
```

And then in the folder ```/src/redux/reducers``` file ```userReducer.ts```

```ts
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { RootState } from "../store";

const initialState = {
  user: null,
};

export const userSlice = createSlice({
  initialState,
  name: "user",
  reducers: {
    // USER LOGOUT
    logout: () => initialState,
    // SAVE USER DATA
    setUser: (state, action) => {
      state.user = action.payload;
    },
  },
});

// GET USER DATA
export const getUser = (state: RootState) => state.user.user;
export const { logout, setUser } = userSlice.actions;
export default userSlice.reducer;
```

We are interested in 3 things here:

 - logout - Clearing the user's state
 - setUser - Saving user data to the user's state.
 - getUser - Retrieving data from the user's state

Let's now import ```userSlice``` into our redux **store**.

```ts
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import userSlice from "./reducers/userSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    user: userSlice,
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
```

Let's now add a ```<Provider />``` component with a **store** plugged in to allow access to Redux data in our application.

It is necessary for ```<Provider />``` to be in the top-level component (mostly it will be **main** or **index** file).

```ts
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import store from './redux/store'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { Router } from './router/Router'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
        <Router />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

```

We still need a function that will handle clearing the state and removing the cookie from JWT. 

```ts
import { Dispatch } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { logout } from "../../redux/reducers/userSlice";
import Cookies from "js-cookie";

export function logoutUser(dispatch: Dispatch) {
  Cookies.remove("jwt");
  dispatch(logout());
  window.location.href = "/login";
}
```
And also a function that will send a request to the API with the stored JWT token and, if successful, write the data to **redux** or, if not, call the logout function.

```ts
import { Dispatch } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { setUser } from "../../redux/reducers/userSlice";
import { userInfoRequest } from "../../client/apiRequests";
import { logoutUser } from "./logoutUser";

export async function getUserDetails(dispatch: Dispatch) {
    // API REQUEST TO GET USER INFO
    const response = await userInfoRequest();
    // IF FAILED - HANDLE LOGOUT USER
    if (response.status !== 200) return logoutUser(dispatch);
    // IF SUCCESS - SAVE DATA TO REDUX STORE
    dispatch(setUser(response.data));
    return true;
}
```


Well, cool, but how is it all supposed to work? - Let me explain:)

Let's assume we have a login form, flow will look as follows:

 1. We log into our account
 2. We save the received JWT token to Cookies
 3. We call the function ```getUserDetails(dispatch)``` - which:
    1. Sends a request to the API with our JWT token in **headers**.
    2. Saves the retrieved data to the state in redux. - If the request was successful
    3. Calls the logout function - If the request was NOT successful

With this solution, we will be sure that our JWT token is valid, because if it is not, the request will not return a status of 200 and will simply log us out.

## 3. Maintaining the user session

We already have practically everything to complete our logic. All that's left to do is to add a mechanism that, when we clear the state from our redux (e.g. when we refresh the page or close the browser), will retrieve the user's data again from **API** using the stored **JWT**.

To handle this, we will create a custom **hook**, so in the ```/src/hooks``` folder we create the ```usePersistUser.ts``` file.

```ts
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import Cookies from "js-cookie";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { getUser } from "../redux/reducers/userSlice";
import { getUserDetails } from "../utils/auth/getUserDetails";

const usePersistUser = () => {
  // GET USER DATA FROM REDUX STORE
  const user = useSelector(getUser);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  // GET JWT TOKEN STORED IN COOKIES
  const token = Cookies.get("jwt");

  // HELPER TO WAIT FOR APPLICATION RENDER BEFORE HOOK JOB FINISH
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  // FUNCTION TO FETCH USER DETAILS 
  const handleGetUserDetails = async () => {
    await getUserDetails(dispatch);
    setLoading(false);
  }

  // USEEFFECT HOOK TO FETCH USER DETAILS WHEN DATA IN REDUX STORE IS EMPTY
  // OR SIMPLY SETLOADING TO FALSE AND RENDER APP WITHOUT TRIGGERING ANY LOGIC
  useEffect(() => {
    if (token && !user) {
      handleGetUserDetails();
    } else {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);

  return loading;
};

export default usePersistUser;
```
As you can see, the logic is quite simple, but effective. Thanks to such a hook, we will always have the user's data at hand, and in case the token expires we will be immediately logged out.

Now all we need to do is to call this hook, preferably in a component directly under that of the highest level (for example, the component responsible for Routing reacta).

```ts
import { getUser } from "../redux/reducers/userSlice";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import usePersistUser from "../hooks/usePersistUser";


export function Router() {
  const loading = usePersistUser();
  const user = useSelector(getUser);

  if (loading) return <>Loading...</>;

  if (!user) console.log("Not logged in")

  if (user) console.log("Logged in");

  return (
    /// ROUTES
  );
}
```

## Summary

As I mentioned earlier, there are many methods to maintain the session of a previously already logged-in user. I presented you with my version, using **Cookies** and **Redux Toolkit**.

The method I presented gives us benefits such as:

- Checking the validity of the JWT token in real time
- User data available "at hand"
- Getting information whether the user is logged in before the view renderer

Enjoy your coding and stay tuned! âœ‹
