The inspiration for Konva Moodboards came from a client I had worked with previously on a website project. During our discussions, he expressed the need for a tool that would allow his website visitors to create moodboards with kitchen decors, helping them visualize design ideas for their homes.

## Concept and Development

To bring this idea to life, I decided to build Konva Moodboards using React and the react-konva library for handling canvas interactions. This combination offered the perfect blend of flexibility and functionality, allowing users to create custom moodboards with ease.

## Features

- **Custom Moodboard Creation:** Konva Moodboards enables users to unleash their creativity by offering a range of customization options. Users can add custom images and backgrounds, arrange them on the canvas, and resize or rotate them to create the perfect moodboard.

- **Export to Images:** Once the moodboard is complete, users can export it as an image file, making it easy to share their creations with others or save them for future reference.

## Challenges and Achievements

Developing Konva Moodboards presented its own set of challenges, particularly in working with canvas interactions and ensuring a seamless user experience. However, with careful planning and dedication, I was able to overcome these obstacles and create a robust and intuitive application.

One of the most rewarding moments was seeing the project gain traction on GitHub, with over 20 stars and positive feedback from the developer community. It was a testament to the hard work and dedication that went into building Konva Moodboards.
