Oferia Automation Bot was a custom-made automation bot that automated the operations of a digital agency company. Designed to automate the process of posting offers on a popular Polish platform, saving the company thousands of hours by streamlining repetitive tasks and increasing efficiency.

## Concept and Development

The idea for Oferia Automation Bot stemmed from the need to streamline the offer posting process for a digital agency company operating in Poland. Recognizing the time-consuming nature of manually posting offers on the platform, I set out to develop a solution that would automate this process using puppeteer—a powerful Node.js library for controlling headless browsers.

Bot automates the entire process of posting offers on the designated platform. By replicating human interactions with the website, the bot is able to log in, navigate to the offer posting page, fill out the required fields, and submit the offer—all without human intervention.
